class Dataset:
    '''
    Defines 'Dataset' class, containing procedures for uploading documents from un-cleaned FASTA files
    and turning them into rich JSONs that can be:
        - Uploaded to the fauna database
        - imported directly by augur (does not take JSONs at this time, instead needs FASTAs)

    Each instance of a Dataset contains:
        1. metadata: list of high level information that governs how the data contained in the Dataset
        are treated by Dataset cleaning functions (TODO: Make these in external scripts as a library of
        functions that can be imported by the Dataset), as well as the exact location in the fauna
        database where the dataset should be stored (TODO: specify in a markdown file somewhere exactly
        what the fauna db should look like).

        ex. [FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE]

        2. dataset: A list of dictionaries, each one identical in architecture representing 'documents'
        that are contained within the Dataset. These dictionaries represent both lower-level metadata,
        as well as the key information (sequence, titer, etc) that is being stored/run in augur.

        ex. [ {date: 2012-06-11, location: Idaho, sequence: GATTACA}, {date: 2016-06-16, location: Oregon, sequence: CAGGGCCTCCA}, {date: 1985-02-22, location: Brazil, sequence: BANANA} ]
